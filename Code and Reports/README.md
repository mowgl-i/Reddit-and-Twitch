use twitch_emote_markdown.Rmd to look/run any code you please. Make sure you visit the data collection folder.

The data you'll need to run this file is: 
  - lsf_data.csv
  - lsf_data_comments.csv
  - chats.csv
  - bttv_emotes.csv
  - ffz_emotes.csv
  
  if you don't want to run any of the code, simply open the html render.
