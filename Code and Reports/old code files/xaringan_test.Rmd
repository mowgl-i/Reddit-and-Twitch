# Getting Started

Recently, twitch literature has begun characterizing twitch communities through twitch chat, viewership trends, and content but no known projects have used resources that exist outside of twitch to understand how twitch communities manifest and interact with one another. 

One subreddit called LivestreamFails (LSF) is a dedicated subreddit where users share these twitch clips. LSF is one way smaller streamers become noticed and is a platform that I can use to compare big and small communities. Furthermore, this will be a companion analysis to another project I have developed using twitch emote sentiment to understand twitch communities.


This analysis will investigate users, posts, and comments (sentiment and topic) on LSF while providing me with an intentional way of selecting clips to use in my companion study.

???

Studies that exist have predominantly used most viewed broadcasters with large communities to begin understanding twitch user behavior. It‚Äôs known that the size of communities on twitch plays a large role in how users behave in the chatroom. One way we can get insight into these differences between small and large communities is by analyzing posts that feature ‚Äútwitch clips‚Äù. Twitch clips are user-generated ‚Äúreplays‚Äù of a broadcast that are commonly shared on Youtube and Reddit. One subreddit called LivestreamFails (LSF) is a dedicated subreddit where users share these twitch clips. LSF is one way smaller streamers become noticed and is a platform that I can use to compare big and small communities. Furthermore, this will be a companion analysis to another project I have developed using twitch emote sentiment to understand twitch communities. This analysis will investigate users, posts, and comments (sentiment and topic) on LSF while providing me with an intentional way of selecting clips to use in my companion study. I also aim to understand how smaller streamers can become ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù on LSF and how to detect rising streamers via the subreddit.

## Data collection
---

# Using Python, R and Bigquery

- Python
  * used this to interact with PRAW (The Python Reddit API) that grabbed 'current' posts.
  * This data is used in the emote(companion) analysis


- R
  * Used to interact with BigqueryR to pull data from the Pushshift reddit dataset which contained historical data from '16. 
  * Collected Reddit posts and Reddit Comments

## LSF Reddit Posts

This is the data that I've collected for reddit posts.

# Descriptions


Here my aim is to support why this kind of data I have is useful for understanding twitch communities using simple visualizations. 


???
Why these 5, how did they help me understand about the problem, how did it help me understand about the domain associated

class: center,middle

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}

lsf_data %>% mutate(year =  as.factor(format(date, "%Y"))) %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(sum(score)) %>% arrange(year)%>%ungroup()%>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y = `sum(score)`, group = 1))+geom_line()+labs(x = "Year", y ="Sum Score" , title ="Sum of Karma by Year",subtitle = "looks like we have increasing interest in LSF over the years") + theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green") + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))

```

???

This is a plot of "Karma" which can be thought of as likes over 3 years on the subreddit. 
As we can see, there is a growing interest in this subreddit since it's recieved more than 4 times the upvotes last year since the 2016.  

My next intereste was too see if there was a karma pattern at the monthly level. 

---
class: center,middle

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}

lsf_data %>% mutate(month =  as.factor(format(date, "%m")),
                    year = as.factor(year(date))) %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>% summarize(sum(score)) %>% arrange(month)%>%ungroup()%>% ggplot(aes(x=month, y = `sum(score)`, group = 1))+geom_line()+
  labs(x = "Month" , y = "Sum of Posts" , title = "Sum of Karma/Points by month")+ theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green")+
  facet_wrap(vars(year))

```


???

Yes there is a pattern at the monthly level! there are 2 clear peaks and dips. This information may be useful for streamers or community members to 'farm' clips or strategicly post on the reddit to maximize the oprotunity of karma or views.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}

library(ggrepel)
lsf_data %>% top_n(10,wt=score) %>% filter(score < 60000) %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = score, label = title, color = as.factor(score)))+
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+
  geom_label_repel(size = 3, vjust ="inward", hjust ='inward',show.legend = F, nudge_y = 10)+
  theme_wsj(base_size = 10,color = "green",base_family = "Segoe Print")+
  labs(title  = "Top 10 upvoted posts by date",caption = "Twitch, youtube, games and memes")+ theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)) 

```

???

Shift gears, let's explore another area of the data, which are posts. There are more than 38,000 posts in the dataset, so let's just look at the top 10 posts over time. 



This visualization helps me understand which types of media are featured on the subreddit. This is great becaues we can see that alot of these posts are *Twitch* related other than the etika post, who is a famous and beloved youtuber. Also, the keanu reeves moment during his presentation at a gaming convention.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}

lsf_data %>% group_by(author) %>% filter(author != "[deleted]") %>% count(sort =T) %>% ungroup() %>% top_n(10) %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(author,n), y =n)) + geom_col()+
coord_flip()+labs(x = "Author",y ="Number of Posts",title ="Which users post the most?",subtitle = "Top 10 users")+ theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green")


```

???

I just showed you the top 10 posts of all time on lsf, now here are the top 10 'poster' on lsf. 

Normiesree has a suspisous amount of posts! Could they be reposts? Are they legit posts? perhaps he's the oldest surviving member of "top posters" on lsf, since many users were [deleted]. 

- I'm going to investigate this further at a later time. 


---

class: center,middle

  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}

lsf_data %>% group_by(author) %>% filter(author != "[deleted]") %>% summarize(sum(score)) %>%top_n(10) %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(author,`sum(score)`), y =`sum(score)`))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(y ="Total Score",x = "User",title = "Top upvoted redditors",subtitle = "Top 10 users")+
  theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green")

```

???

Who are the most upvoted users? Normiesree again! 
If normiesree's posts are legitament, this person has a lot of influence on the narritive of lsf?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 8.5, fig.width=10}
lsf_data %>% group_by(url) %>% count(sort = T)%>% filter(n > 2) %>% ggplot(aes(x = url, y =n, fill = url)) + geom_col()+labs(x = "Link",y ="Number of Posts/Reposts",title ="Number of URL Reposts",subtitle = "Top 10 Links")+ theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green")+theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.direction = "vertical", legend.title = element_blank(),axis.line.x = element_blank(),axis.ticks.x = element_blank()  ) + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 3))

# This needs to be fixed

```
  

???

This here will show the number of duplicate links that happen on LSF. 

LSF is pretty good at removing duplicate / very similar posts, so those seen here shouldn't be repost. Rather, these are new posts that happen throughout time. I expected that the numbers would be much larger. For example this shows that streamers Mitch jones and Erobb221 are frequently featured on LSF, denoted by the twitch link. 


---

```{r}
library(lubridate)
lsf_data %>% group_by(domain, year(date)) %>% count() %>% filter(n>50)  %>% ggplot(aes(x = `year(date)`, y = n , color = domain ))+
  geom_line()+ theme_wsj(base_size = 9,base_family = "Segoe Print",color = "green")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank(),plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))+ labs(title = "Post Links over time.", subtitle = "Filtered for links occuring more than 50 times")

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('Âú∞ÁàÜÂ§©Êòü', 'Â§©ÁÖß', 'Âä†ÂÖ∑ÂúüÂëΩ', 'Á•ûÂ®Å', 'È†à‰ΩêËÉΩ‰πé', 'ÁÑ°ÈôêÊúàË™≠')
grep('Â§©', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(lsf_data, 5),
  fillContainer = T, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

---

# Some Tips

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

- If you want to restart the play after it reaches the last slide, you may set the sub-option `loop` to TRUE, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay:
            interval: 30000
            loop: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.
    
---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

````
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
*{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```
````
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

---

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a d≈çjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ / É/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (ÂÜôËº™Áúº; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (ÊúàË™≠; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (Êü•ÂÖãÊãâ; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (ÊÄßË≥™Â§âÂåñ; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (ÁÑ°ÈôêÊúàË™≠; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
